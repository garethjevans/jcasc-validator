For example, a Jenkinsfile\n        may contain configuration details to sandbox pull requests in order to mitigate against malicious pull requests.\n        In order to protect against a malicious pull request itself modifying the Jenkinsfile to remove\n        the protections, you can define the trust policy for pull requests from forks.\n    \n    \n        Other plugins can extend the available trust policies. The default policies are:\n    \n    \n        Nobody\n        \n            Pull requests from forks will all be treated as untrusted. This means that where Jenkins requires a\n            trusted file (e.g. Jenkinsfile) the contents of that file will be retrieved from the\n            target branch on the origin repository and not from the pull request branch on the fork repository.\n        \n        Collaborators\n        \n            Pull requests from collaborators\n            to the origin repository will be treated as trusted, all other pull requests from fork repositories\n            will be treated as untrusted.\n            Note that if credentials used by Jenkins for scanning the repository does not have permission to\n            query the list of collaborators to the origin repository then only the origin account will be treated\n            as trusted - i.e. this will fall back to Nobody.\n            NOTE: all collaborators are trusted, even if they are only members of a team with read permission.\n        \n        Everyone\n        \n            All pull requests from forks will be treated as trusted.

For example, a Jenkinsfile\n        may contain configuration details to sandbox pull requests in order to mitigate against malicious pull requests.\n        In order to protect against a malicious pull request itself modifying the Jenkinsfile to remove\n        the protections, you can define the trust policy for pull requests from forks.\n    \n    \n        Other plugins can extend the available trust policies. The default policies are:\n    \n    \n        Nobody\n        \n            Pull requests from forks will all be treated as untrusted. This means that where Jenkins requires a\n            trusted file (e.g. Jenkinsfile) the contents of that file will be retrieved from the\n            target branch on the origin repository and not from the pull request branch on the fork repository.\n        \n        Forks in the same account\n        \n            Bitbucket allows for a repository to be forked into a \"sibling\" repository in the same account but using\n            a different name. This strategy will trust any pull requests from forks that are in the same account as\n            the target repository on the basis that users have to have been granted write permission to account in\n            order create such a fork.\n        \n        Everyone\n        \n            All pull requests from forks will be treated as trusted.

Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take care\n        to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts.  Mailbox domains are not case sensitive.\n    \n    This is in conflict with the case sensitivity rules for the standard LDAP attribute used to hold email addresses\n    (mail) which specifies caseIgnoreIA5Match, e.g. as noted in\n    RFC 2798\n    \n        ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3\n           NAME 'mail'\n           EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match\n           SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch\n           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26{256} )\n         \n        Note: RFC 1274 uses the longer name\n        'rfc822Mailbox' and syntax OID of 0.9.2342.19200300.100.3.5. All recent LDAP documents\n        and most\n        deployed LDAP implementations refer to this attribute as 'mail'\n        and define the IA5 String syntax using using the OID\n        1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26, as is done here.\n    \n    So when the user search filter is mail={0} it is pointless to select anything other than\n    Case insensitive as the LDAP server will be ignoring case when searching anyway.\n    \n    If you do need to select a case sensitive strategy because you are searching on a custom attribute you should note\n    that the Case sensitive (email address)\n    strategy applies RFC 2821's rules on case sensitivity (i.e. the\n    local-part is case sensitive and the mailbox domain is case insensitive), thus with that strategy\n    JOE@ACME.COM and JOE@acme.com will be considered the same Jenkins user\n    while joe@acme.com will be considered as a different Jenkins user.\n    \n    \n    \n        Note: UNIX login names are case sensitive",
